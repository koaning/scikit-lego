poem = """
roses are red, violets are blue,
naming your package is hard to undo. 
patience can make decisions in one fell swoop,
note that LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group.
it really makes sense, we do not need to bluff,
LEGO does not sponsor, authorize or endorse any of this stuff.

defer responsibility to the end user,
this might just empower them.
all the features and every extension,
the path towards ruin is paved with good intentions.
you cannot understand a problem by avoiding it,
but sometimes it goes away if you ignore them.
if you don't know the requirements you don't know if they're met,
if you haven't gotten to where you're going, you aren't there yet.
the unknown may be ignored,
but infinity is ever present.
