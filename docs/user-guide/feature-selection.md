# Feature Selection

## Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy

!!! info "New in version 0.8.0"

The [`Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy`][MaximumRelevanceMinimumRedundancy-api] (MRMR) is an iterative feature selection method commonly used in data science to select a subset of features from a larger feature set. The goal of MRMR is to choose features that have high *relevance* to the target variable while minimizing *redundancy* among the already selected features.

MRMR is heavily dependent on the two functions used to determine relevace and redundancy. However, the paper [Maximum Relevanceand Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection Methods for a Marketing Machine Learning Platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05376.pdf) shows that using [f_classif](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html) or [f_regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression.html) as relevance function and Pearson correlation as redundancy function is the best choice for a variety of different problems and in general is a good choice.

Inspired by the Medium article [Feature Selection: How To Throw Away 95% of Your Data and Get 95% Accuracy](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-selection-how-to-throw-away-95-of-your-data-and-get-95-accuracy-ad41ca016877) we showcase a practical application using the well known mnist dataset.

Note that although the default scikit-lego MRMR implementation uses redundancy and relevance as defined in [Maximum Relevanceand Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection Methods for a Marketing Machine Learning Platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05376.pdf), our implementation offers the possibility of defining custom functions, that may be necessary in different scenarios depending on the data.

We will compare this list of  well known filters method:

- F statistical test ([ANOVA F-test](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html)).
- Mutual information approximation based on sklearn implementation.

Against the default scikit-lego MRMR implementation and a custom MRMR implementation aimed to select features in order to draw a smiling face on the plot showing the minst letters.



??? example "MRMR imports"
    ```py
    --8<-- "docs/_scripts/feature-selection.py:mrmr-commonimports"
    ```

```py title="MRMR mnist"
--8<-- "docs/_scripts/feature-selection.py:mrmr-intro"
```

As custom functions, we implemented the smile redundancy and smile relevance.

```py title="MRMR smile functions"
--8<-- "docs/_scripts/feature-selection.py:mrmr-smile"
```

Then we execute the main code part.

```py title="MRMR core"
--8<-- "docs/_scripts/feature-selection.py:mrmr-core"
```

After the execution it is possible to inspect the F1-score for the selected features:

```py title="MRMR mnist selected features"
--8<-- "docs/_scripts/feature-selection.py:mrmr-selected-features"
```

```console hl_lines="5-6"
Feature selection method: f_classif
F1 score: 0.854
Feature selection method: mutual_info
F1 score: 0.879
Feature selection method: mrmr
F1 score: 0.925
Feature selection method: mrmr_smile
F1 score: 0.849
```

The MRMR feature selection model provides better results compared against the other methods, although the smile technique performs rather good as well.

Finally, we can take a look at the selected features.
