# Docs readme

The docs folder contains the documentation for the scikit-lego package.

The documentation is generated using [Material for MkDocs][mkdocs-material], its extensions and a few plugins.
In particular the `mkdocstrings-python` is used for API rendering.

## Render locally

To render the documentation locally, you can run the following command from the root of the repository:

```console
make docs
```

Then the documentation page will be available at [localhost][localhost].

## Remark

The majority of code and code generate plots in the documentation is generated using the scripts in the `docs/_scripts` folder,
and accessed via the [pymdown snippets][pymdown-snippets] extension.

To generate the plots from scratch it is enough to run the following command from the root of the repository:

```console
cd docs
make generate-all
```

which will run all the scripts and save results in the `docs/_static` folder.
